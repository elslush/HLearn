This is the README file of a release of the Visualization of Protein Ligand Graphs (VPLG) software package.

VPLG uses a graph-based model to describe the structure of proteins on the super-secondary structure level. A protein-ligand
graph is computed from the atomic coordinates in a PDB file and the secondary structure assignments of the DSSP algorithm. In
this graph, vertices represent secondary structure elements (SSEs, e.g. usually alpha helices and beta sheets) or ligand
molecules while the edges model contacts and spatial relations between them.

VPLG is written in Java using the Apache Batik library for SVG output. Database connectivity (optional) is provided by
the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. VPLG was tested on Linux and Windows and should also run under MacOS.

VPLG was written by Tim Schaefer at the Molecular Bioinformatics group of Ina Koch at Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany. It
is based on earlier ideas by Ina Koch and Patrick May.

The official VPLG website is at http://vplg.sourceforge.net/.

VPLG is free software and comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. See the LICENSE file for details.

This is the README for the *vpg* program (vpg.jar), which is part of *VPLG* (Visualization of Protein Ligand Graphs).

VPLG is free software and comes without any warranties. See the license for details.

Description
============

The *vpg* program is a frontend for VPLG and provides a graphical user interface (GUI). You can run the *plcc* program from it without the need to type long commands, view resulting graph image files and more.


Installation and System Requirements
====================================

The *vpg* program is written in Java and requires an JRE 1.6, which is available at http://java.sun.com free of charge for many platforms.



Running the program
===================

To run *vpg*, double-click the file vpg.jar or run the following command line:

  java -jar vpg.jar
  
That's it.


Setup and Configuration
=======================

This program creates a config file at '<USERHOME>/.vpg_settings'. Feel free to edit it or use the config editor in the GUI.

Some options are also parsed from the PLCC config file at '<USERHOME>/.plcc_settings'. If you do not have this file yet, you can create it by running PLCC once (java -jar plcc.jar).

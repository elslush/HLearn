How to install VPLG
===================


Make sure you have Java >= 1.6 installed (the JRE will do, you do not need the SDK). You can run 'java -version' if
in doubt. 


After unpacking the release archive, all tools can be run directly from the resulting directory structure. 


   cd my_downloads_directory/
   unzip vplg-<version>.zip

   cd vplg/
   java -jar plcc.jar                            or
   java -jar vpg.jar                             or
   java -jar splitpdb.jar



To start the graphical user interface on a GUI system with properly installed Java, simply double-click the file 'vpg.jar'.

(If the JAR file does not run at all or gets opened in some other application like an archiver, you need to edit the program 
associated with the '.jar' file extension in your operating system or desktop environment. The program should be 'java' and the
command should be something like 'java -jar %f'.)

Note that the programs require the libraries in the lib/, relative to their path. So if you copy them elsewhere, you
gotta copy the lib/ directory there as well.


See the README_* files for more detailed instructions on how to install and use the tools.

This is the VPLG release log.
=============================


(Latest changes are near the end of this file.)


Updates from version 2012-01-24 to 2012-01-30:
================================================
* Default rule set for atom and residue contacts is now PTGL compatible
* SSE contact rules changed for (H, E) contact pairs
* Javadoc fixes, old functions marked as deprecated
* Added lots of debug code and some new debug options
* It is now possible to restrict computations to a specific chain on the command line


Updates from version 2012-01-30 to 2012-02-21:
================================================
* fixed bitmap output support (-m)
* fixed some database-related security issues
* database structure has also been changed slightly
* output files can now be written to a directory tree similar to the PDB directory structure to avoid problems with thousands of output files in a single directory (-k)
* add support for gzipped input files
* many other fixes


Updates from version 2012-01-21 to 2012-04-17:
================================================
* support for deleting a protein from the database
* splitpdb now also supports gzipped input PDB files and can also write gzipped output files
* computation of a spatial vertex ordering of a graph if possible for the graph
* based on this vertex ordering, the KEY notation from the Protein Topology Graph Library can also be computed
* database layout changes and fixes
* work on similarity methods for protein graphs (--similar command line option, similarity src package)
* changed the values of some default settings inthe cfg file


Updates from version 2012-04-17 to 2012-06-05:
================================================
* option to filter ligands based on their atom count, e.g., you can configure the program to include only ligands which have between n and m atoms. You can set the borders n and m in the PLCC configuration file using the plcc_I_lig_min_atoms and plcc_I_lig_max_atoms options. Setting the former to 1 and the latter to a value <0 (which are the defaults) means that all ligands are considered.
* changes under the hood, most notably usage of generics for the graph classes to unify them and make all of them extend a single base class.
* lots of new output formats to allow the usage of graphs generated by VPLG with other software: 
   -GML: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in Graph Modelling Language format (.gml files, see http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/files/lehrstuhl/brandenburg/projekte/gml/gml-technical-report.pdf by Himsolt or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language for more info). The GML output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_GML option in the VPLG config file. With GML support, you can now load graphs generated by VPLG in programs like yEd () and Gephi (http://gephi.org/).
   -TGF: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in Trivial Graph Format format (.tgf files). This output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_TGF option in the VPLG config file.
   -DOT language: option to save the computed protein graphs to text files in DOT language format . This output is on by default and can be turned off by modifying the plcc_B_output_DOT option in the VPLG config file, it writes .gv files. This allows you to open the graphs with GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/) and other software.

Updates from version 2012-06-05 to 2012-07-19:
===============================================
* Added first version of the new VPG GUI.
* A number of bug fixes for PLCC


Updates from version 2012-07-19 to 2012-07-30:
===============================================
* Many bug fixes for the new VPG GUI, including:
  -Now using the correct working dir when running PLCC, which prevents library-related crashes when using the database!
  -A lot more documentation is available using tool tips, so just hover your mouse over an option if you need help
  -Instant validation of input/output settings in all forms of VPG, invalid settings are marked in red
* Some smaller fixes to PLCC, including:
  -more detailed output
  -output format improvements
  -option to turn off DSSP file warnings for PDB files with several models


Updates from version 2012-07-30 to 2012-08-07:
===============================================
* some fixes and many new features for VPG:
  -new form to generate a DSSP file from a PDB file using SplitPDB and dsspcmbi by Kabsch and Sander
  -rearranged main menu
  -keyboard shortcuts (ALT) and accelerators (CTRL) for menu items


Updates from version 2012-08-07 to 2012-08-17:
================================================
* PLCC:
  - Folding graphs are drawn like protein graphs now (instead of using unfinished alternate representation which is still under development)
  - Output graph formats can now be specified on the command line (new -O or --outputformats option)
* VPG:
  - The form to generate a DSSP file has the option to automatically delete temporary PDB files after the run
  - New Help form (F1) which shows basic info on getting help for VPLG
  - Added basic validation to the PDB and DSSP file download URLs in the settings frame 

Updates from version 2012-08-17 to 2012-09-07:
================================================
* PLCC:
  - new command line option '-C' or '--create-config' to create a default config, then exit
  - added Kavosh edge list output format
  - changed '--outputformats' command line option, PLCC format is now a format like all others ('p') and 'x' does not write it anymore
  - improvements to GML and DOT language exporters: better annotations of the graphs
  - added new backbone contact type and option to force backbone contacts (-B or --force-backbone)
  - comments on more DB tables
* VPG:
  - updated GUI to new PLCC features
  - new experimental batch frame for creating DSSP files from PDB input files (using SplitPDB and dsspcmbi)
  - new experimental batch frame for creating graphs from PDB and DSSP files
  - many small bug fixes


Updates from version 2012-09-07 to 2012-09-14:
================================================
* PLCC: 
  - added option to write all output files to a PDB-style subdirecotry structure (-K, -k), e.g. '<BASEOUTPUTDIR>/ic/8icd/8icd_A_albelig_PG.gml')
  - fixed command line parsing of output formats, kavosh edge list format is now 'e' as described in help (it was 'k' before)

Updates from version 2012-09-14 to 2012-10-11:
================================================
* PLCC: 
  - folding graphs can now be written in all supported graph formats, no only PLCC format
  - GML-format graphs now contain the ligand name as a vertex comment for ligand vertices
  - more useful output (but not more output)
  - removed the difference between -K and -k command line options, it made no sense
* VPG:
  - increased size of some input text fields

Updates from version 2012-10-11 to 2013-03-25:
================================================
* PLCC (new version 0.70):
  - fixed handling of alternate location PDB field for PDB files which do not have valid atoms in default location:
    we now choose the AltLoc which has a CA atom and maximizes the number of atoms (only the latter for non-AAs)
  - updates to javadoc and small fixes
* VPG (new version 0.24):
  - the log file is now written to the user home (instead of a subdir which may not exist at that time)

This is the README for the *splitpdb* program (splitpdb.jar), which is part of *VPLG* (Visualization of Protein Ligand Graphs).

VPLG is free software and comes without any warranties. See the license for details.


Description
============

The *splitpdb* program is used to prepare PDB that contain several models for *dsspcmbi*. It parses the PDB file, extracts data on a specific model from the file, and writes the data to a new PDB file. If the input PDB file does not contain any models, the output file is a copy of the input file. By default, the first model is used, but this can be configured (see below).


Installation and System Requirements
====================================

The *splitpdb* program is written in Java and requires an JRE 1.6, which is available at http://java.sun.com free of charge for many platforms.



Running the program
===================

This is a command line program. The *vpg* frontend can be used to run this program and automatically generate the command line, but not all options are available from within *vpg*.

To extract the first model from the PDB file *1tst.pdb* and have *splitpdb* write the resulting PDB output file to *1tst.pdb.split*, use the following command line:

  java -jar splitpdb.jar 1tst.pdb
  
You can specify the model and the output file name on the command line. Run the following command for details:

  java -jar splitpdb.jar --help



Setup and Configuration
=======================

This program does not have a config file and there is no need to configure anything. All options have to be set on the command line.

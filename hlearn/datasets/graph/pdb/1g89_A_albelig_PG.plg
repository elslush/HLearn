# This is the plcc format protein graph file for the albelig graph of PDB entry 1g89, chain A.
# First character in a line indicates the line type ('#' => comment, '>' => meta data, '|' => SSE, '=' => contact).
# The graph meta data follows in format '> key > value'.

# Printed info on 1 SSEs.
# The contacts between the SSEs follow in format '= SSE1 = contact_type = SSE2'. The SSEs are labeled by their position in this graph.
